# An exciting frontend mentor project 
In this project I was able to learn and deploy some interesting concepts and I ended creating a very functional and fully responsive user interface!

## Some of the concepts I found particularly interesting include:
CSS
1. Clamp() method in CSS. It was the deal breaker for getting the project fully responsive
2. Setting container div's width to 'min-content' in order to set an image as the background while you are able to add texts on the image without a hassle (or better yet, with just a little hassle, just a little. LOL)
3. Other concepts like grid and flexbox, and a lot of tweaks to CSS conventions, LOL.

JavaScript
1. Regex. A concept I used to get textfield's input to allow only whatever you want (numbers only, letters only or both, etc). Quite fun!
2. selectionEnd property to create an automatic space after every 4 digits inputted as cardnumber. Fun!
3. The window localStorage property
4. The array map() method and several eventlisteners.
